Hello !!!
My name is Zaghab Sofiene 
Email : sofiene.zaghab@essat-gabes.com

This is a simple Android Studio App that I create it using Java and xml.
In this app, I created :
	-MainActivity that's displayed in pic1.jpg
		Where is used a personnal adapter list extended from BaseAdapter to arrange the display
		I used the OnItemClick to delete a "Matiere" (pic3.jpg)
		Also i used SQLite DataBase (V2.4)
	-AjoutActivity :
		I used a display Message to alert the user that "Titre" and "Niveau" must not be empty
		(pic3.jpg)
		and the object "Matiere" will not be added unless "Titre" and "Niveau" are not empty
